# braintapper-svelte-icon

SVG icons

Icons are from http://materialdesignicons.com/ (License: https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/blob/master/LICENSE)

This component does not use all the icons from materialdesignsicons.com, only the ones used by Braintapper applications.

It's highly recommended that you fork this component as opposed to using this one as is, since it likely does not have icons you need.
